# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Academic Excellence
Every chapter and lesson must adhere to rigorous academic standards; Content must be thoroughly researched, properly cited, peer-reviewed; Clear learning objectives required - no content without pedagogical purpose.

### II. Modularity & Structure
Every chapter operates as a standalone unit; Content must be self-contained, independently understandable, properly documented; Clear scope defined - no chapter without a specific learning outcome.

### III. Test-First Education (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Learning objectives must be defined before content creation; Exercises and assessments written first to verify objectives are measurable and achievable; Each lesson must include practice problems and solutions.

### IV. Cross-Disciplinary Integration
Focus areas requiring integration across disciplines: Physical AI concepts, Humanoid Robotics principles, ROS 2 applications, Simulation environments, NVIDIA Isaac platforms, Sensor systems, Vision-Language-Action agents, Conversational Robotics, and locomotion dynamics.

### V. Practical Application
Each theoretical concept requires hands-on examples; Code examples must be complete, tested, and production-ready; Every simulation exercise must connect to real-world applications in robotics.

### VI. Docusaurus Excellence
All content formatted specifically for Docusaurus compatibility; Custom React + Tailwind UI components required; Complete documentation of layouts, components, sidebar, and typography.

## Additional Constraints

Technology stack requirements: Docusaurus, React, Tailwind CSS, GitHub Pages deployment; Compliance with academic publishing standards; Deployment policies requiring production-ready code and complete documentation.

## Development Workflow

All content must follow specification, plan, and tasks stages strictly; Code review requirements for all implementation; Testing gates for all functionality; Deployment approval process through documentation validation.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use development guidance for project execution.
