# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This textbook is designed to provide a deep understanding of the principles, technologies, and applications of physical artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## Course Overview

This textbook is structured into four main chapters, each focusing on critical aspects of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2** - Learn about the Robot Operating System version 2, essential middleware for robotics applications
2. **Chapter 2: Gazebo & Unity Simulation** - Explore simulation environments for testing and developing robotics applications
3. **Chapter 3: NVIDIA Isaac** - Understand NVIDIA's robotics platform and tools
4. **Chapter 4: Vision-Language-Action** - Study the integration of perception, reasoning, and action in robotics

Each chapter is divided into multiple lessons that progressively build your knowledge from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations.

## Learning Outcomes
